# Web-Scraping-Thesaurus
small visual thesaurus implementation

We mix python and Java script by using python to access the thesaurus.com website and gather synonyms from it. This is a fun application, and you can add features to it like graphs within graphs (like picking the most relevant synonyms and calling the function on those to create an iterative cluster, such as the one made by Visual Thesaurus)

The original goal was to creat a clone of Visual Thesaurus but I ran out of time, and since 95% of the work is already done, it feels trivial at this point.
